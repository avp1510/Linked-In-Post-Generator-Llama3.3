While the global Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) market is projected to reach $300 billion by 2030, the global labor market is worth over $50 trillion. Agentic AI shifts the conversation from software as a tool to AI as digital labor, capable of performing autonomous, iterative tasks that were once the sole domain of humans.",
